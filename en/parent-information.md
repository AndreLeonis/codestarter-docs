Hello and welcome to Codestarter!

We’re a nonprofit organization that works to provide a laptop to every student
who wants to learn how to code, but who doesn’t have their own computer. We
believe that coding is an important skill for future careers and for creating
amazing projects right now. 

Our mission at Codestarter goes beyond providing laptops to kids and enabling
them to learn how to code. This is about long-term change for diverse
communities. We believe that kids who have their own laptops will be more likely
to choose careers as software engineers. This will benefit the children, their
families, their communities, and also the tech industry, because more people
from diverse backgrounds will solve different problems with unique solutions. 

Codestarter is monitoring the progress of all children who receive laptops on
loan or permanently. We want to learn, for example, what subjects Codestarter
kids like to study best and least, whether they attend college, and what careers
they choose. Children will need to complete four short surveys in the first year
and annual evaluations in the future. We won’t share individual children’s
identities publicly. You will find a Parent or Guardian Consent form included as
part of the Codestarter registration process.

We’re delighted that you’re considering joining us. Together we can build a
creative future, and it all starts with giving kids their own computers. If you
have any questions, feel free to visit our website at https://codestarter.org or
email us directly at info@codestarter.org.

Sincerely,

Theresa Preston-Werner
Cofounder and CEO
