Dear Parent or Legal Guardian: 

You child has expressed interest in applying to receive a laptop from
Codestarter so that he or she can learn about computer programming. Codestarter
provides free laptops to kids who are enrolled in programming classes so that
they will have their own computers. Your child will receive the laptop on loan
during a trial period. Upon successful completion of the trial, he or she will
earn the laptop to take home and keep! For more information, visit our website
https://codestarter.org; we have an extensive FAQ list.

Codestarter’s website may require the collection, use, and disclosure of minors’
information. For example, we ask for applicants’ names, birthdates, favorite
school subjects, and how many siblings they have. 

We administer quarterly and annual surveys in order to track the progress of
each child who receives a laptop, because we want to study the impact of giving
laptops to kids and teaching them how to code. 

We believe in transparency, and so we share a lot of the data that we gather
publicly. We do not share personally identifiable information, such as
children’s names, phone numbers, or home street addresses, except as set forth
in our privacy policy.

On our website, we post photos of some of the children who receive laptops. We
create pseudonyms and do not use real names. Donors will see a brief “profile”
of your child, including a short essay written by various students.

As you may be aware, state and federal law require website operators to
implement certain protections prior to allowing children to operate, interact
with, or be showcased on websites. As a 501(c)(3) charitable organization, we
are not subject to the Children’s Online Privacy Policy Act (COPPA) but we still
want to be upfront with you. We make available a Terms of Use and Privacy
Policy: https://codestarter.org/privacy.

Please review this direct notice, read our full Privacy Policy and Terms of Use,
and make a determination about whether you provide your consent for your child’s
participation in our website. If you have any questions, you may contact:
