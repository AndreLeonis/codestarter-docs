# Codestarter Docs and Translations

This repository contains text versions of various documents we use at
Codestarter. We're aiming to reach a wide audience, and would love to have
translations from the English into other languages.

Each directory should be named after the two-letter ISO 639-1 language code of
the translation. These two-letter codes can be found on the following Wikipedia
page:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes

Filenames should be the same as the English version.
